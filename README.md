## Course Description:

This course is a semester long project-based exploration of fullstack web development. By the end of this course, you will be fully prepared for an internship in frontend web development, and will have experience in deploying web apps that connect to real-world data using APIs and databases. You'll have to opportunity to develop creative projects unique to your interests that can be implemented in the real world.

In the first part of the course, you will build your web development skills by completing practice labs and building fully functional web apps on your own.

In the last three weeks of the course, you will apply your skills to design and build an original web app from the ground up. The course culminates in a Demo Day event where each team will present their finished web app in a live demo.

## Course Format:

This courses teaches intermediate web development in a project-based format over a 10-unit period. Each unit builds on the skills and knowledge developed in the previous weeks.

Each unit will consist of:

- **2 Hours of In-Class Time**, consisting of:
    - **Interactive Lecture:** An instructor-led discussion of this unit's topics and how they apply to real-world Web Development.
        - *Estimated time: 30-60 minutes (synchronous)*
    - **Unit Lab:** Each unit, you will get hands-on practice by working through a lab assignment that covers the concepts taught in the lecture. This is meant to be done synchronously so that you can talk with peers and your instructors/TAs while working through them for assistance! While the lab is designed to be completed during the session, you may optionally work outside of class to add stretch features to your website.
        - *Estimated time: 1+ hours (synchronous)*
- **Unit Project:** Now that you've had practice implementing the concepts for this unit in the lab, you'll get the chance to practice on your own! Each week, you'll build a website similar to the one you build in the lab, outside of class.
    - *Estimated time: 5-10 hours (asynchronous)*

Throughout the 10 units of the course, you will learn and practice the skills you'll need to build your final project. The final project will be a two-unit project that you will have class time for in Units 8 & 9. While you'll have time to work on the project in class, you may have to work outside of class to complete your website. The last day of class during Unit 10 is reserved for Demo Day, when you'll get to showcase your completed websites!
